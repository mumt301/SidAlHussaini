            <p>San Cisco is an indie band from Fremantle, Australia that formed in 2009. Their band consists of Jordi Davieson (lead vocals/guitar), Scarlett Stevens (drums/vocals), and Josh Biondillo (guitar/vocals). Davieson, Biondillo, and past member Nick Gardner were in the same high school, while Stevens attended a nearby college. Davieson and Stevens had their own separate bands, but eventually in 2009, they formed the band with Biondillo and Gardner under the name 'King George.' They changed their name to 'San Cisco' after surveying friends and fans.</p>
